# Bad Spelling Generator
Bad spelling generator re-spells text while keeping the pronunciation the same. See it live at [badspellinggenerator.com](badspellinggenerator.com)

This repo includes the **webapp** (source for the website) and the **scripts** (which create files for use in the website, as well as contains the Jupyter notebook that was used to create data visualisations).
